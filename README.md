Collection of files and demos associated with SciPy 2020 Talk "Oceanography, Data Ontology, and the Semantic Web"

Repo with examples of how to explore and plot data in the BCO-DMO data repository using the BCO-DMO Knowledge Graph with Python and Jupyter

Try running `BCO-DMO_SPARQL_intro_No-data.ipynb` in Binder to explore the BCO-DMO Knowledge Graph with python and SPARQL!

(The interactive map visualization will not work on Binder.)

Browse the BCO-DMO Knowledge Graph via the SPARQL endpoint: https://lod.bco-dmo.org/browse/
Check out the Ocean Data Ontolody (odo:) https://ocean-data.org/schema/

*WARNING*: The number of SPARQL requests made at one time on the BCO-DMO endpoint is limited. Additionally, the number of results on the endpoint is capped at 10,000 (common restriction for public SPARQL endpoints).
